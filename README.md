 My Favorite Projects Involving the Python Library Pygame

 Here are a couple of the projects I created while exploring the pygame library for game development in python. The projects in this repo so far are simple pong, simple snake, a simulation of conway's game of life, and a recreation of the new york times puzzle spelling bee. To run the games, simply run setup.py to install pygame onto your local machine.
